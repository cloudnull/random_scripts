Take a Script Leave a Script
----------------------------

This is a collection of scripts that happen live on my hard drive and so I've 
created this repo to put them all here. Some of them are useful for some 
people others are not useful at all except to me.

Pull requests welcome, if you have something that you want to add to the repo 
please feel free to add whatever you like.  


Requirements
------------

* Be good netizens.
* All scripts within this repo will be licensed Apache 2.0 if a License is not 
  provided in the header of the script.  If you choose a different license 
  other than Apache 2 please upload a corresponding `LICENSE_NAME`-License.txt 
  file to the ``licenses`` directory.
* If you would like to be a collaborator please shoot me a message and I will 
  add you.
* No language will be discriminated against; bash, perl, python, haskel, batch
  go, and even ruby are all acceptable.
* Do not place scripts in the root directory, rather create a directory within
  the repo should one not exist that fits the purpose of the script you're 
  sharing.
