# Usage:
# $:./database_backup.sh

# Overview:
# When running a Grizzly to Havana Upgrade this should be the first step. The
# simple BASH script will Backup all of the your databases as found in MySQL.
# Note this only works with MySQL. The script saves a backup of all databases as
# individual files in a backup directory which can be customized by setting the
# "DB_BACKUP_DIR" environment variable. If the Backup directory does not exist
# it will be created. You will also need to either have a ".my.cnf" file set in
# your home directory with access to the root MySQL user or know the root MySQL
# password if the file does not exist.

# Available Overrides:
#     DB_BACKUP_DIR="/Directory/Name"


set -e
set -u

# Set the full path to the MYSQL commands
MYSQLDUMP=$(which mysqldump)
MYSQL=$(which mysql)
TAR=$(which tar)

# If a my.cnf file is not found, force the user to enter the mysql root password
if [ ! -f "${HOME}/.my.cnf" ];then
    echo -e "No \".my.cnf\" in \"${HOME}\". You are going to need the MySQL" \
            "Root password."
    MYSQL="${MYSQL} -u root -p"
    MYSQLDUMP="${MYSQLDUMP} -u root -p"
